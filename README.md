# Key Results

1.  Steady-State Output:The output voltage successfully stabilizes at 5V  with minimal ripple.
   

2.  Load Regulation: The controller maintains 5V even when the load is changed (e.g. 5 Omega to 10 Omega ), proving its robustness.
   

3.  Efficiency: The simulated efficiency is [ 92.5%].

# How to Use

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open `BuckConverterClosedLoop_PID.slx` in MATLAB/Simulink.
3.  Run the simulation to see the results.
